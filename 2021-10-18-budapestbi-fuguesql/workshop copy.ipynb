It has some differences from standard SQL that will be shows here. \n","\n","FugueSQL aims to be more English-like, and provide a fun interface for Data Analysts to work with data in their tool of choice. The FugueSQL notebook extension allows users to use FugueSQL with syntax highlighting in Jupyter notebook cells\n","\n","Fugue also has a programming interface that is not covered in this notebook. The programming interface is not covered here, but the link to the repo and Slack channels are listed below if anyone is interested.\n","\n","## Links \n","\n","Fugue is a pure abstraction layer that makes code portable across differing computing frameworks such as Pandas, Spark and Dask. It allows users to write code compatible across all 3 frameworks. It guarantees consistency regardless of scale and a unified framework for compute. All questions are welcome in the Slack channel.\n","\n","[![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](https://fugue-project.github.io/tutorials/) ⬅️ Open the
